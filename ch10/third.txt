Notice that the preceding example closes the file stream after the try block that reads the
file has completed. Although this approach is occasionally useful, Java supports a variation that
is often a better choice. The variation is to call close( ) within a finally block. In this approach,
all of the methods that access the file are contained within a try block, and the finally block
is used to close the file. This way, no matter how the try block terminates, the file is closed.
Assuming the preceding example, here is how the try block that reads the file can be recoded:
